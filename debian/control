Description: set timestamps to the date of a file's last commit
 This utility can set timestamps in a git checkout to the last commit that
 changes a given file.  This is useful whenever meaningful mtimes are wanted,
 as "last change" is better than "last checkout".  Use cases include syncing
 timestamps on a web server's contents, preparing a release tarball, etc.
 Pretty much, every scenario other than an unclean source tree where you're
 about to type "make" without "make clean".
 .
 When called from a .git/hooks/post-checkout trigger, this is the equivalent
 of Subversion's "use-commit-times".
 .
 Unlike metastore, git restore-mtime gives you only commit times rather than
 the true original timestamp; on the other hand it works retroactively and
 doesn't require a manual action by every contributor in every working copy.
